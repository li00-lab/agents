Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations.<br/><br/>If you have time, I'd love it if you submit a PR for changes in the community_contributions folder - instructions in the resources.

       "Designing a fair and effective voting system for a diverse society requires a multifaceted approach that prioritizes representation, inclusivity, and the minimization of undue influence from special interest groups. Here are key steps and considerations to achieve this:\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. Establish a Proportional Representation System\n",
       "- **Mixed-Member Proportional (MMP)**: Combine single-member districts with proportional representation. This ensures both local representation and that minority voices are reflected in the overall legislature.\n",
       "- **Party List System**: Use party lists for a portion of seats to help represent diverse political views, allowing voters to choose based on ideology instead of individual candidates, which may be influenced by special interests.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. Implement Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)\n",
       "- RCV allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference. This approach:\n",
       "  - Reduces the impact of tactical voting.\n",
       "  - Promotes broader coalitions and encourages candidates to appeal to a wider audience.\n",
       "  - Helps third parties and independents gain representation.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. Strengthen Election Campaign Regulation\n",
       "- **Public Funding of Campaigns**: Provide public financing options for candidates to level the playing field and reduce reliance on large donors or special interests.\n",
       "- **Transparency in Funding**: Implement strict disclosure requirements for campaign contributions, ensuring that voters can see where funding is coming from, thus reducing the influence of special interest groups.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. Enhance Voter Accessibility and Education\n",
       "- **Simplified Voting Process**: Utilize user-friendly technology and clear instructions to make voting accessible to all demographics.\n",
       "- **Voter Education Programs**: Invest in programs that inform citizens about candidates and issues, targeting underserved communities to encourage informed participation.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 5. Implement Automatic Voter Registration\n",
       "- Ensure all eligible citizens are automatically registered to vote, reducing barriers to participation and increasing engagement, particularly among underrepresented groups.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 6. Create Independent Redistricting Commissions\n",
       "- Prevent gerrymandering by establishing independent bodies to draw electoral district boundaries, ensuring fair representation and preventing manipulation by partisan interests.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 7. Encourage Deliberative Democracy\n",
       "- Foster community discussions, town halls, and forums to engage citizens in dialogue about important issues, allowing diverse voices to be heard and considered in the political process.\n",
       "- Utilize online platforms to engage younger and tech-savvy citizens, providing multiple avenues for participation.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 8. Foster Inclusive Political Parties\n",
       "- Promote diversity within political parties to ensure they reflect the demographics and interests of the society. Encourage the nomination of candidates from underrepresented backgrounds to enhance representation.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 9. Utilize Technology Wisely\n",
       "- Use secure and transparent technology solutions for voting (e.g., blockchain, secure online platforms) to enhance accessibility and trust in the voting process.\n",
       "- Facilitate online platforms for campaigning and voter outreach, making it easier for candidates to connect with constituents without relying on traditional media influenced by special interests.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 10. Implement Continuous Feedback Mechanisms\n",
       "- Establish mechanisms to regularly assess the effectiveness and fairness of the voting system. Conduct surveys, focus groups, and analyses to adaptively improve the system based on citizen feedback.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion\n",
       "By combining these elements, the voting system can be designed to promote fair representation, minimize the influence of special interests, and engage all citizens, ultimately creating a more robust and participatory democracy. This approach requires collaboration among various stakeholders, continuous improvement, and vigilance in protecting the integrity of the electoral process."

      "Designing a fair and effective voting system for a diverse society requires a multifaceted approach that prioritizes representation, inclusivity, and the minimization of undue influence from special interest groups. Here are key steps and considerations to achieve this:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Establish a Proportional Representation System\n",
      "- **Mixed-Member Proportional (MMP)**: Combine single-member districts with proportional representation. This ensures both local representation and that minority voices are reflected in the overall legislature.\n",
      "- **Party List System**: Use party lists for a portion of seats to help represent diverse political views, allowing voters to choose based on ideology instead of individual candidates, which may be influenced by special interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Implement Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)\n",
      "- RCV allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference. This approach:\n",
      "  - Reduces the impact of tactical voting.\n",
      "  - Promotes broader coalitions and encourages candidates to appeal to a wider audience.\n",
      "  - Helps third parties and independents gain representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Strengthen Election Campaign Regulation\n",
      "- **Public Funding of Campaigns**: Provide public financing options for candidates to level the playing field and reduce reliance on large donors or special interests.\n",
      "- **Transparency in Funding**: Implement strict disclosure requirements for campaign contributions, ensuring that voters can see where funding is coming from, thus reducing the influence of special interest groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Enhance Voter Accessibility and Education\n",
      "- **Simplified Voting Process**: Utilize user-friendly technology and clear instructions to make voting accessible to all demographics.\n",
      "- **Voter Education Programs**: Invest in programs that inform citizens about candidates and issues, targeting underserved communities to encourage informed participation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Implement Automatic Voter Registration\n",
      "- Ensure all eligible citizens are automatically registered to vote, reducing barriers to participation and increasing engagement, particularly among underrepresented groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. Create Independent Redistricting Commissions\n",
      "- Prevent gerrymandering by establishing independent bodies to draw electoral district boundaries, ensuring fair representation and preventing manipulation by partisan interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. Encourage Deliberative Democracy\n",
      "- Foster community discussions, town halls, and forums to engage citizens in dialogue about important issues, allowing diverse voices to be heard and considered in the political process.\n",
      "- Utilize online platforms to engage younger and tech-savvy citizens, providing multiple avenues for participation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 8. Foster Inclusive Political Parties\n",
      "- Promote diversity within political parties to ensure they reflect the demographics and interests of the society. Encourage the nomination of candidates from underrepresented backgrounds to enhance representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 9. Utilize Technology Wisely\n",
      "- Use secure and transparent technology solutions for voting (e.g., blockchain, secure online platforms) to enhance accessibility and trust in the voting process.\n",
      "- Facilitate online platforms for campaigning and voter outreach, making it easier for candidates to connect with constituents without relying on traditional media influenced by special interests.\n",
      "\n",
